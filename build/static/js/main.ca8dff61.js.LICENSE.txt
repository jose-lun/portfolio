* The following copyright and license were part of the original implementation available as part of FreeBSD [k_sin.c]{@link https://svnweb.freebsd.org/base/release/9.3.0/lib/msun/src/k_sin.c} and [k_cos.c]{@link https://svnweb.freebsd.org/base/release/9.3.0/lib/msun/src/k_cos.c}. The implementation follows the original sine and cosine kernels, but has been modified for JavaScript and combined into a single function.
